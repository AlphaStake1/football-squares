# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js 13.5.1 fantasy football web application called "Football Squares" - a pre-MVP stage project that combines NFL squares gameplay with fantasy football resource discovery. The app is configured for static export deployment.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production (static export)
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint

# Git workflow (uses conventional commits)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
git commit -m "feat(component): description"
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

## Architecture

### Framework & Tools
- **Next.js 13.5.1** with App Router and TypeScript
- **Static export** configuration (output: 'export')
- **shadcn/ui** design system with Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with CSS variables and dark mode support
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation

### Project Structure
```

├── page.tsx           # Homepage with main component layout
├── providers.tsx      # App-wide providers
└── globals.css        # Global styles and CSS variables

```

### Component Patterns
- All custom components use default exports
- UI components from shadcn/ui use named exports
- Client components marked with 'use client' directive
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, focus management)

### Styling System
- Uses shadcn/ui default theme with neutral base color
- CSS variables for theming (supports dark mode)
- Tailwind utility classes with custom color palette
- Primary brand color: `#1b5e20` (dark green)

### Key Dependencies
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives (@radix-ui/react-*)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with tailwindcss-animate
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Theme**: next-themes for dark mode
- **Notifications**: Sonner for toasts

## Development Notes

- ESLint is configured to ignore build errors (ignoreDuringBuilds: true)
- Images are unoptimized for static export compatibility  
- Uses conventional commit format for Git workflow
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Follows feature-branch workflow targeting main branch
